/*
 * Maximus v1.2.1
 * mathematical.coffee@gmail.com.
 * May 2012.
 *
 * This extension attempts to emulate the Maximus package[1] that
 * Ubuntu Netbook Remix had, back when people still used that.
 *
 * Basically whenever a window is maximised, its window decorations (title
 * bar, etc) are hidden so as to space a bit of vertical screen real-estate.
 *
 * This may sound petty, but believe me, on a 10" netbook it's fantastic!
 * The only information lost is the title of the window, and in GNOME-shell
 * you already have the current application's name in the top bar and can
 * even get the window's title with the StatusTitleBar extension[2].
 *
 * Note that since the title bar for the window is gone when it's maximised,
 * you might find it difficult to unmaximise the window.
 * In this case, I recommend either the Window Options shell extension[3] which
 * adds the minimise/restore/maximise/etc window menu to your title bar (NOTE:
 * I wrote that, so it's a shameless plug),  OR
 * refresh your memory on your system's keyboard shortcut for unmaximising a window
 * (for me it's Ctrl + Super + Down to unmaximise, Ctrl + Super + Up to maximise).
 *
 * Small idiosyncracies:
 * Note - these are simple enough for me to implement so if enough people let
 * me know that they want this behaviour, I'll do it.
 *
 * * we only remove decoration from fully-maximised windows. If it's maximised
 *   in one dimension only (like when you snap a window to take up half a screen),
 *   window decoration remains.
 * * the original Maximus also maximised all windows on startup.
 *   This doesn't (it was annoying).
 *
 * Help! It didn't work/I found a bug!
 * 1. Make sure you can *reproduce* the bug reliably.
 * 2. Do 'Ctrl + F2' and 'lg' and see if there are any errors produced by Maximus,
 *    both in the 'Errors' window *and* the 'Extensions' > 'Maximus' > 'Show Errors'
 *    tab (the 'Show Errors' is in GNOME 3.4+ only I think).
 * 3. Disable all your extensions except Maximus and see if you can still reproduce
 *    the bug. If so, mention this.
 * 4. If you can't reproduce th bug with all extensions but Maximus disabled, then
 *    gradually enable your extensions one-by-one until you work out which one(s)
 *    together cause the bug, and mention these.
 * 5. Open a new issue at [4].
 * 6. Include how you can reproduce the bug and any relevant information from 2--4.
 * 7. Also include:
 * - your version of the extension (in metadata.json)
 * - list of all your installed extensions (including disabled ones, as
 *   this is no guarantee they won't interfere with other extensions)
 * - your version of GNOME-shell (gnome-shell --version).
 * 8. I'll try get back to you with a fix.
 * (Brownie points: open a terminal, do `gnome-shell --replace` and reproduce the
 *  bug. Include any errors that pop up in this terminal.)
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * It's actually possible to get the undecorate-on-maximise behaviour without
 * needing this extension. See the link [5] and in particular, the bit on editing
 * your metacity theme metacity-theme-3.xml. ("Method 2: editing the theme").
