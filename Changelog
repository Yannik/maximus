v1.3:
* FEATURE: added the ability to blacklist or whitelist applications [m.coffee]
* BUGFIX: windows should redecorate on full -> partial window maximization if
undecorateHalfMaximized is false [Michael Kirk]
* BUGFIX: return a string not a vector for the window X ID if parsing the
output of `xwininfo -children` [m.coffee; #4]
* Misc code reorganisation (decorate, undecorate, guessWindowXID functions
are the core ones. The callbacks simply make use of these) [m.coffee, Michael Kirk]
